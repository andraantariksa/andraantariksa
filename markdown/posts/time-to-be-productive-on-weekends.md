I feel guilty whenever I do nothing on my day off from work. As someone who works 9 to 5, I can barely afford more productive time on weekdays. After my 9 to 5 job, I do my chores and work out, which usually finishes at 8:00 PM. Then I have time to work, which would be less than 4 hours since I need to sleep by midnight at the latest.

I once talked to my friend about my concern and how I should allocate my day off. They just said, "That's why it's called a day off—you just do nothing." Sure, you need to take time to just relax. But I still feel stressed about wasting my time. I have "nothing to be proud of", and that's why I feel I have to "work" or be productive. The work that should be done on weekends doesn't have to be literal "working." It can be in the form of traveling, learning, trying out new activities, working out—heck, even exploring new places counts as productive for me.

The problem for me is that I usually do most of them spontaneously and not efficiently enough, especially on long weekends. I guess I need to plan my weekends more meticulously to avoid "do nothing" day.
