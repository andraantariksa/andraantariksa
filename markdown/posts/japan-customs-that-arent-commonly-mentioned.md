Here are some ~Tokyo~ Japan in general customs I noticed that aren't commonly mentioned:

- Wear long pants—shorts will make you stand out big time
- Don't use any perfume other than neutral scents on public transport
- Don't talk at all on public transportation
- Always check for ticket machines, ordering tablets, or QR codes on tables when you go into restaurants. It's fine to ask if you're confused, as long as they're not obvious
- Always put your money on the tray when paying. I kept forgetting this one
- Keep the rush hours in mind (07.30-9.30 and 17.30-19.30)
- Take off your shoes when entering clothing fitting rooms. Taking off shoes in houses is normal in Indonesia, but this just isn't common there
- Not every bus has a flat fare—on some buses you need to tell the driver where you're going and pay when you get on
- Learn the road signs like intersections, slopes, and one-way streets. Super handy even if you don't drive or ride a bike
- Not every station has elevator

You also need to assume that nobody in Tokyo speaks English except in touristy areas. You need to know basic phrases like numbers, food terms, and how to say sorry. I found that using an LLM works better than Google Translate since you get context explanations. Some menu are written in "sinosphere-style", you need AI to understand them.

Maps and getting around are pretty easy—just remember your destination name, line name, platform number, and read the signs. You'll never get lost. I never got lost even in huge stations like Shinjuku because the signs are super clear.

Good luck on your trip to Japan!
