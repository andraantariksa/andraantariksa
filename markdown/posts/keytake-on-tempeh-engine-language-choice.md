- Dawn and wgpu-rs are moving on a slight different direction. They both have their own advantages.
- For now (January, 2022), Dawn does not support Android yet.
- Building Dawn is far more complicated.
- Rust and C++ has not a really noticeable compile time difference.
- Rust ecosystem is very lacking. It does not have any mono library. However we can spent on time porting the library FFI to Rust API.
- More to come...
